Makes 1 – 8″ Pie

## Ingredients

* 4 – Chicken Thighs (skinless, boneless or bone-in)  
* 1 Tsp Ground Cumin  
* 1 Tsp Ground Coriander  
* 1 Tsp Ground Cinnamon  
* 1 Tsp Ground Ginger  
* 1 Tsp Ground Galangal  
* 1 Tsp Ground Tumeric  
* 1 Tsp Kosher salt  
* 1 Tsp Granulated Garlic  
* Olive oil  
* 3-5 strands Saffron  
* 1 Onion, finely minced or pureed  
* 2 TBSP Minced Garlic  
* 1 TBSP sugar  
* 2 C Chicken Stock  
* 3 Eggs, beaten  
* 3/4  C Sliced/Flaked Almonds  
* 1 Pkg. Sheet Phyllo, thawed  
* 3 TBSP butter, melted  
* Powdered Sugar & Cinnamon

## Directions

1. Mix together the Cumin, Coriander, Cinnamon, Ginger, Galangal, Tumeric, Salt, and Granulated Garlic.  
2. Coat chicken thighs with olive oil and liberally season with spice mix, rubbing the oil and spices into the meat. Set aside the remaining spice mixture.  
3. Place seasoned chicken in a glass, or lightly oiled metal, baking dish, and tent with foil.  
4. Bake in a pre-heated, 375°F oven, for 35 – 45 min, until the chicken is browned and reads at least 165°F with an internal thermometer. Set aside to cool  
5. Soak 3-5 strands of saffron in 1 TBSP of hot water for 10 minutes. Discard the strands, but retain the soaking liquid.  
6. Once the chicken is cool enough to handle, pull the meat off the bones, discarding the skin and bones, but reserving the juices.  
7. Break the chicken into pieces, and place into a food processor with leftover juices. Pulse until chicken mixture resembles dry tuna.  
8. Heat the olive oil in a large, heavy bottom skillet over medium heat. Add onion and minced garlic and cook for 1-2 minutes.  
9. Stir in the remaining spice mix and sugar, and cook, stirring often, until fragrant.  
10. Stir in saffron liquid, chicken stock, and chicken meat mixture, and cook over a medium-high heat until all of the liquid has evaporated, and the mixture is paste-like.  
11. Reduce the heat to medium-low, stir in 3 eggs, and cook, stirring often, until the eggs have congealed.  
12. Remove mixture from heat, stir in almonds, and set aside to cool.  
13. Preheat oven to 400°F, and carefully unroll phyllo sheets onto a damp towel, and cover with another damp towel.  
14. Brush an 8″ round cake pan with butter, and carefully add layers of phyllo around pan, brushing each new layer with more butter. Allow the edges of the phyllo to drape over the edges of the cake pan and work around the pan until the entire pan is covered by at least two layers of phyllo.  
15. Pour in the cooled chicken mixture and spread to fill pan evenly.  
16. Fold the draped edges of phyllo upwards, buttering between each layer, until the entire mixture is encased in phyllo.  
17. Brush the top of the pie with butter and bake 20 – 30 minutes, until golden.  
18. Invert the pie onto a serving dish, so the folds are now on the bottom of the pie, and dust the top with powdered sugar and cinnamon.  
19. Serve immediately.

## Notes

* Could possibly be made Dairy Free by substituting the butter for a butter alternative or additional oil, but I have not tried that yet.
